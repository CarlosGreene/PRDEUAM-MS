   abstract = {Predicting students’ academic performance has been a research area of interest in recent years, with many institutions focusing on improving the students’ performance and the education quality. The analysis and prediction of students’ performance can be achieved using various data mining techniques. Moreover, such techniques allow instructors to determine possible factors that may affect the students’ final marks. To that end, this work analyzes two different undergraduate datasets at two different universities. Furthermore, this work aims to predict the students’ performance at two stages of course delivery (20\% and 50\% respectively). This analysis allows for properly choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms to use as well as optimize the algorithms’ parameters. Furthermore, this work adopts a systematic multi-split approach based on Gini index and p-value. This is done by optimizing a suitable bagging ensemble learner that is built from any combination of six potential base machine learning algorithms. It is shown through experimental results that the posited bagging ensemble models achieve high accuracy for the target group for both datasets.},

The overarching feature of the majority of these research studies has been on the science of prediction only. The component of predictive analytics concerned with interpreting the internals of the models and explaining their predictions for individual cases to stakeholders has largely been neglected. Additionally, works that attempt to employ data-driven prescriptive analytics to automatically generate evidence-based remedial advice for at-risk learners are in their infancy. eXplainable AI is a field that has recently emerged providing cutting-edge tools which support transparent predictive analytics and techniques for generating tailored advice for at-risk students. This study proposes a novel framework that unifies both transparent machine learning as well as techniques for enabling prescriptive analytics, while integrating the latest advances in large language models for communicating the insights to learners. This work demonstrates a predictive modelling framework for identifying learners at risk of qualification non-completion based on a real-world dataset comprising ∼7000 learners with their outcomes, covering 2018 - 2022. The study further demonstrates how predictive modelling can be augmented with prescriptive analytics on two case studies to generate human-readable prescriptive feedback for those who are at risk using ChatGPT.},

   abstract = {Predicting students’ performance in distance courses is a very relevant task to help teachers identify students who need reinforcement or extension activities. Nevertheless, identifying the student’s progress is highly complicated due to the large number of students and the lack of direct interaction. Artificial intelligence algorithms contribute to overcoming this problem by automatically analyzing the features and interactions of each student with the e-learning platform. The main limitations of the previous proposals are that they do not consider a ranking between the different marks obtained by students and the most accurate models are usually black boxes without comprehensibility. This paper proposes to use an optimized ordinal classification algorithm, FlexNSLVOrd, that performs a prediction of student’s performance in four ranking classes (Withdrawn < Fail < Pass < Distinction) by generating highly understandable models. The experimental study uses the OULA dataset and compares 10 state-of-the-art methods on 7 different courses and 3 classical classification metrics. The results, validated with statistical analysis, show that FlexNSLVOrd has higher performance than the other models and achieves significant differences with the rest of the proposals. In addition, the interpretability of FlexNSLVOrd is compared with other rule-based models, and simpler and more representative rules are obtained.},

   abstract = {<p>Academic performance (AP) is crucial for lifelong success. Unfortunately, many students fail to meet expected academic benchmarks, leading to altered career paths or university dropouts. This issue is particularly pronounced in the early stages of higher education, highlighting the need for the instructors of these foundational courses to have access to simple yet effective tools for the early identification of students at high risk of academic failure. In this study, we propose a streamlined conceptual model inspired by the Model of Human Behavior (MHB) to which we have incorporated two dimensions: capacity and willingness. These dimensions are assessed through the definition of three variables: Prior Academic Performance (PAP), Personality and Academic Engagement, whose measurements can easily be obtained by the instructors. Furthermore, we outline a Machine Learning (ML) process that higher education instructors can use to create their own tailored models in order to predict AP and identify risk groups with high levels of transparency and interpretability. The application of our approach to a sample of 322 Spanish undergraduates studying two mathematical subjects at a Spanish university demonstrates its potential to detect failure early in the semester with a precision that is comparable with that of more complex models found in literature. Our tailored model identified that capacity was the primary predictor of AP, with a gain-to-baseline improvement of 21\%, and the willingness variables increasing this to 27\%. This approach is consistent over time. Implications for instructors are discussed and an open prediction and analysis tool is developed.</p>},

   abstract = {Student drop-out is one of the most burning issues in STEM higher education, which induces considerable social and economic costs. Using machine learning tools for the early identification of students at risk of dropping out has gained a lot of interest recently. However, there has been little discussion on dropout prediction using interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools.In this work, using the data of a large public Hungarian university, we demonstrate how IML and XAI tools can support educational stakeholders in dropout prediction. We show that complex machine learning models – such as the CatBoost classifier – can efficiently identify at-risk students relying solely on pre-enrollment achievement measures, however, they lack interpretability. Applying IML tools, such as permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plot (PDP), LIME, and SHAP values, we demonstrate how the predictions can be explained both globally and locally. Explaining individual predictions opens up great opportunities for personalized intervention, for example by offering the right remedial courses or tutoring sessions. Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates whether higher education stakeholders find these tools interpretable and useful.},

   abstract = {In recent years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become the main online learning method for students all over the world, but their development has been affected by the high dropout rate for a long time. Therefore, dropout prediction is a vital task for early teaching intervention and user retention. The students’ learning records are stored in MOOCs, which contain high-dimensional time series features. However, these features are hard to process, and the nonlinear relationship between the features is difficult to learn. These limitations have become obstacles to improve the performance in dropout prediction. In this paper, we propose a new neural dimension-reduced dropout prediction model based on neural network model to address the limitations. The proposed model, called CNNAE-LSTM, is constructed by convolutional neural network autoencoder (CNNAE) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). Specifically, CNNAE-LSTM compresses the students’ learning features into a low-dimensional latent space for reconstruction through CNNAE, then projects the latent space, retains the representative features in the learning records, and finally minimizes the reconstruction error to obtain the nonlinear relationship between features and dropout. The introduced LSTM neural network can obtain the time evolution of its latent vector. Our experiments on the KDD CUP 2015 dataset and the real-world dataset XuetangX demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits better predictive performance compared to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

   abstract = {The percentage of passing courses is dependent on the assistance provided to students. To ensure the effectiveness of these efforts, identifying students at risk of course failure as early as possible is crucial. The list of students at risk can be generated through academic performance prediction based on historical data. However, the number of students failing (7\%) is significantly lower than the number succeeding (93\%), resulting in a class imbalance that hampers performance. A widely adopted technique for addressing class imbalance issues is synthetic sample oversampling. Many oversampling techniques neglect discrete features, whereas the existing technique for discrete features treats all features uniformly and does not select samples as a basis for generating synthetic data. This limitation is capable of introducing noise and borderline samples. As a result, this study introduced a novel discrete feature oversampling technique called GLoW SMOTE-D. This technique accelerated the improvement of minority sample learning by performing multiple selections and multiple weighting in order to effectively reduce noise. Experimental results showed that this technique significantly enhanced the performance of students' failure in the course prediction model when compared to various other techniques across a range of performance measures and classifiers.},

   abstract = {A massive estimation of computerized data is been created for an extensive combination in the data mining area. The conception of student performance prediction models focused to classify the academic performance of student is the important factor of the growth of Education Data Mining (EDM). It is one of the important and predictable processes that are performed over the huge education background. Data mining methods are employed to build the prediction models for the educational dataset. But it has issue with huge amount of features from the specified dataset hence the prediction accuracy of student's performance is degraded significantly. To overcome the above mentioned problems, in this work, Improved Conditional Generative Adversarial Network -with Parallel Support Vector Machine (ICGAN-PSVM) algorithm is proposed. It is focused to predict students' performance under supportive learning through school and family tutoring which increases the prediction accuracy considerably. This research includes main steps are feature selection and prediction process. The feature selection process is done via Modified Chicken Swarm Optimization (MCSO) algorithm. It is utilized to choose the more appropriate features from the University dataset. The objective function of MCSO algorithm is used to improve the students' performance via selecting best fitness features. Then the prediction is performed by using ICGAN-PSVM algorithm which is used to classify the more accurate student's performance prediction results. From the experimental result, it concludes that the proposed ICGAN-PSVM algorithm gives higher sensitivity, specificity and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) rather than the existing algorithms},

   abstract = {A significant amount of research works has tackled the problem of students' performance prediction. The introduction of learning management systems enabled providing teachers and students with accurate predictions to take remedial actions, and enhance students' achievement. This paper proposes a new students' performance prediction model based on different academic and non-academic features. We use a filter-based feature selection model to select a subset of the features that can describe the input data and reduce feature space dimensionality. A subsequent classification algorithm classifies students' feature vectors to predict student performance. The obtained results reveal a strong relationship between students' behavioral features and academic achievement. Moreover, results indicated that a Random Forest classifier with 5-fold cross-validation outperforms other algorithms, including Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbor, and Artificial Neural Network. Applying a Random Forest classifier on the reduced number of features provide 83.33%, 82.8, and 83% for accuracy, precision, and recall, metrics, respectively.},

   abstract = {Data analytics and data mining techniques are increasingly being used to assist managers, business leaders, and policymakers in their decision-making. These techniques help them distill the useful information hidden in their ever-growing databases that are distributed across various data stores. Another area in which these techniques are utilized is the education domain, wherein data analytics can be leveraged to predict students' academic performance. Teachers will therefore be better informed in providing their students with additional support if required. Learning Management Systems (LMS) captures student online learning data and are extensively used by researchers to gather data-driven insights on students' overall academic performance. This study aims to predict students' academic performance with the LMS data from an online training course using various machine learning algorithms. The study further highlights that selection of features by using feature selection methods will enable early prediction of student academic performance. Early predictions can benefit those students who are considered to be at risk of failing a course with targeted early interventions to help improve their performance throughout the course.},

   abstract = {Identifying student learning outcomes data in a subject to predict student performance is interesting research. This study was conducted to identify the factors that affect student performance by applying feature selection techniques based on Particle Swarm Optimization (FSPSO) and feature selection techniques based on Genetic Algorithm (FSGA) on the Machine Learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR). The data used are students' personal data and data on the academic value of Mathematics in Portugal. Experiments were carried out by applying the PSO feature selection (FSPSO) and GA (FSGA) feature selection techniques to obtain the selected features. Then the prediction modeling of student performance was carried out using SVR. The experiment was carried out using the pycharm 2021.1 application with the python programming language. This study uses a 10-fold cross-validation method. Evaluation of student performance prediction modeling is done by comparing the error values of regression performance metrics and processing time with feature selection and without feature selection. The experimental results show that FSPSO-SVR modeling compared to SVR modeling, the error reduction of the regression performance metric on RMSE is 34.36\%, while for MAE it is 45.09\% in 500 iterations. In FSGA-SVR modeling compared to SVR modeling, the error reduction of the regression performance metric in RMSE is 1.59\% , while the MAE is 3.04\% at iteration 50. The improvement of the time process value in the FSPSO-SVR modeling compared to the SVR modeling, resulted in a decrease in process time of 44.68\%. while the FSGA-SVR modeling compared to SVR modeling, resulted in a decrease in process time of 33.33\%. From the comparison of experimental results, it can be concluded that the FSPSO-SVR modeling is the best predictive modeling of student performance with the lowest error value and the fastest time process in 500 iterations, so it can be used as a reference in making decisions to improve student performance in the future.},

   abstract = {One of the major issues in Educational Artificial Intelligence is detecting university student dropouts. Student dropout prediction is a growing research area since dropouts have financial, social, and national consequences. To deal with this issue, we examined the performance of ten machine learning algorithms with different feature sets in predicting university student dropout. Used algorithms are: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Stacking Classifier, Adaboost, XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Multi Layer Perceptrons. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) balancing algorithm is used in the training process, to balance training data since the used dataset has an imbalanced nature. On the student dataset from Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, we obtained 92 \% accuracy on the XGBoost algorithm with a sub-feature set. We showed that the selected data features are as important as the selected method. Considering different performance metrics other than accuracy for imbalanced data is important. Having economic and historical score data increases accuracy. We also have seen that XGBoost and Random Forrest algorithms were the best for this task.},
